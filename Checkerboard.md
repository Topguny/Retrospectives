# Retrospective: CheckerBoard
1.
2. I would Say I pretty well understood the programming concepts and foundational knowledge to complete this assignment. It was after all our first assignment I believe for the semester so it was not too complicated. Also I feel like we may have done a checkerboard in 3330, also having Dale do another example, albeit he did not use an anchorpane in his in class example I think.

P.S. It is hard to remember all the details from doing this project, because it was from the beginning of the semester. I wish we would have done the retrospective a week after we had completed this assignment.
