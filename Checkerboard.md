# Retrospective: CheckerBoard
1. I feel like I did alright, it was weird getting back into java because I had been using C# more recently which was refreshing, so that was big. I also could have probably simplified some stuff down more now looking back. Getting the board not to get squished or wonky from moving the window size around is something I did better than the solution for sure, but that was also not required. That was also honestly the hardest thing I did in the project.
2. I would Say I pretty well understood the programming concepts and foundational knowledge to complete this assignment. It was after all our first assignment I believe for the semester so it was not too complicated. Also I feel like we may have done a checkerboard in 3330, also having Dale do another example, albeit he did not use an anchorpane in his in class example I think.
3. I feel like I completed all of the requirements set out by the challenge, at least from comparing my code to the checkerboard.pdf's requirements I did not miss anything. I believe I also met the requirements correctly.
4. For the most part the match pretty spot on, my if statement is slightly different for handling the filling of colors in squares. Also mine makes sure the squares stay square the box is moved around, while the solution does not. It does this by adding padding to the board to keep the board/squares square.
5. I am sure there are things I could improve, my if statement to check for filling squres is more complicated than it needs to be, and I see that from seeing the solution. I should also add more comments to my code, code can almsot always use more comments. I also feel like I understand what was required for the assignment.

P.S. It is hard to remember all the details from doing this project, because it was from the beginning of the semester. I wish we would have done the retrospective a week after we had completed this assignment.
